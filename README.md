# Python-learning
  There are some learning experience and code for my individual python learning.
You cannot directly run these test code because I combine some of functions or test code
in one single .py file, but 99% of my code is worked, therefore you can copy blocks of them
to run in your Python Interaction.
  By the way, I use Python v3.6.1 in my computer, make sure your Python vision is Python 3.
  
  Thanks~
